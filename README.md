# AWS Batch ML Service

## Project Idea:
(Consulting Project)
Make it easy for data scientists to put ML models into production such that the model can scale.  

## Tech Stack
- S3
- Lambda
- AWS Batch
- Redshift

## Data Source
Provided by company. 

## Engineering Challenge
1. Scaling the model
2. Handeling simultaneous or overlapping calls to the model

## Business Value
This platform will tell you when to leave for the airport to pick-up your party, so that you are not cirling the airport waiting for them to walk-out.

## MVP
Automate the process of running the ML model. (Once data in S3, trigger the model and save the predictions)

## Stretch Goals
Store multiple models in DB.
